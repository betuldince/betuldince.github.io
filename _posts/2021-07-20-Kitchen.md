This project is made for well-known household appliances company Arçelik. We worked as a team and I was VR developer of the group. We imagined an environment where users could try the products without going to the stores in person. Also, we developed several solutions for engineers working at Arçelik to work remotely with each other.


I used Unity and SteamVR for this project. And it is tested in HTC Vive VR Headset.
