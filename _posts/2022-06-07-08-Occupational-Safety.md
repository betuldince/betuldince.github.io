## Occupational Safety VR App

Educating workers about occupational hazards has never been easier. All you have to do is give the headset to the workers. The app provides users with detailed information and guidance. With this application, you can save time and money as well as making training more fun for workers. 


The application consists of two scenes. First scene is for explaining game to users and giving workers enough time to get used to VR. They wear gloves and helmet in this scene and they click the start button to start the experience.

In the second scene, there is a factory scene and the user select the risk by left controller. After they find all the risk, they can see their point and the time in the paper they are holding.

I believe that virtual reality applications are useful for training and educational purposes. And it can fewer the real-world hazards during the training.
