I've developed an interactive multiplayer VR game designed to encourage children to exercise. 


In this virtual app, players are divided into three distinct teams, each represented by vibrant colors: blue, yellow, and green. The heart of the game lies in a riveting race against time, player's mission is to collect fruits and accumulate a substantial point total. Ultimately, the player who accumulates the greatest number of points within the allotted time emerges victorious. 

For this game, I used Unity 3D, Oculus SDK, and online database servers for multi-player option.
