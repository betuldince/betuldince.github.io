Greetings! I am a dedicated graduate student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. My academic journey has been marked by prestigious achievements, including the receipt of both the Fulbright and Keith Uncapher Scholarships in recognition of my outstanding dedication to furthering my graduate studies.

My academic background is as diverse as it is enriching. I hold degrees in Electrical & Electronics Engineering and Media & Visual Arts from Koc University in Turkey, a testament to my multidisciplinary approach to learning. This unique blend of knowledge has fostered in me a profound appreciation for the convergence of technology and design, a passion that drives my pursuits.

Enthusiastic about open-source initiatives, I find great joy in contributing to the collaborative world of technology. My research interests are equally diverse, spanning immersive technologies, serious games, human-computer interaction, wearable sensors, and signal processing.  

Beyond personal ambition, I am fueled by a profound belief in the transformative potential of immersive technologies. It is my conviction that these technologies should transcend mere entertainment, finding purpose in realms as vital as medicine, education, refugee support, data visualization, and professional industries. My drive to effect meaningful social change propels me towards crafting experiences that harness the power of immersive technologies.

As I journey forward, I aspire to channel my motivation into designing captivating and purposeful immersive experiences. With a keen eye on social impact, I am steadfast in my resolve to contribute to a world where technology, thoughtfully applied, can shape lives for the better.
