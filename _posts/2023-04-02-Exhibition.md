Collaborating with the Traditional Turkish Art Department at Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, this project merges technology with the traditional practice of carpet weaving. 


The exhibition, Ortak Mekik, showcased various projects that ingeniously combined AR/VR/immersive technologies with the rich history of carpets. In the beginning and ending of the exhibition, my project was performed by a Carpet Weaving professor, Gulcin Aksoy.

My contribution involved translating traditional carpet weaving motions into generative music, yielding a project that received considerable attention. To accomplish this, I employed Windows Kinect 2, Arduino Uno, HC-SR04, and Unity software. Initially, I generated sine waves based on hand positions along the x and y axes. Subsequent prototypes entailed smoothing raw sine wave sounds through filters and constructing a sound grid. Under the pedals, distance sensors were placed to identify which pedal was pressed. By mapping three-dimensional hand movements onto a 2D plane, the notes associated with touched keys were played.
