Augmented reality (AR) merges the real world with digital elements by creating a virtual environment around the user, allowing interaction between the two. Medical AR applications are swiftly diversifying across healthcare sectors, encompassing diagnostics, treatment planning, patient monitoring, mental health, and rehabilitation, transforming the healthcare landscape.


This AR-based application was made for children receiving treatment at Koç Hospital. Our aim is to create a digital therapy friend who contributes to therapy by talking to children for 12 weeks. With this application, we won the Abdi İbrahim “We Heal the Future” contest. 

For this project, I build the mobile application in Unity by using Vuforia and AR foundation plugin.
