To encourage children undergoing chemotherapy to stay active on the days they receive treatment at the hospital.


I created this game as part of my Senior project in Media and Visual Arts. I undertook the entire process, from designing and sketching to coding the game, and even handling the hardware development. The objective of this game is to motivate children undergoing chemotherapy to engage in physical movement during their hospital stays while receiving serum. The game halts whenever the cycling action stops, and at pivotal moments, users are required to raise the corresponding hand. This approach effectively encourages patients to remain active, all while enjoying a gamified version of the popular movie "Encanto." Moreover, due to the modular design of this system, it has the flexibility to target various age groups by simply changing the storyline.

Rather than purchasing costly cadence sensors, I developed my own cadence sensor. I put a distance sensor on the bicycle's frame, which returns reduced distances whenever the pedal moves past the sensor. I then measured the time until the subsequent passage. A brief time interval indicates a rapid pace, while a longer interval suggests the opposite. Additionally, I employed the Microsoft Kinect 2 sensor to detect hand movements.
