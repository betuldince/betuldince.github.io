The primary objective of this project was to provide support and relief to children with cancer
undergoing chemotherapy treatment.


We accomplished this by creating a VR application that
incorporated a biofeedback mechanism and utilized both the Oculus Quest 2 and ADXL sensor
to track the patient's breathing. The application was designed to reinforce deep/slow breathing,
thereby reducing pain and anxiety experienced during port needle insertion. Our team
collaborated with Koc Hospital throughout the development process. We were also successful in
passing the final stage of the TUBITAK "Technology for Humanity" competition. As a result of
our hard work, the project was nominated as a Best Senior Design candidate by professors and
TAs. Ultimately, our aim was to leverage technology to offer cancer patients a way to cope with
a difficult and painful aspect of their treatment process. As a team of two, we collaborated to
design and construct the game's scenes and create the overall experience for our project. My
primary responsibility in the team was to code the game mechanisms, ensuring they were
functioning correctly and contributing to an engaging user experience. Additionally, I integrated
the sensors into the game, ensuring that they were operating correctly and aligned with the
game's mechanics.
