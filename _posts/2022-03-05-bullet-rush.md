I developed a game like Bullet Rush for NoSurrender in my internship. The instructions were as follows,

- The project should be mobile-oriented.
- Unity version 2020.3.18f should be used.
- Only the game scene will be work. At the end of the game, the Popup Screen (if Win is the button to switch to the next level. If it is Lose, the button to restart) will appear and the relevant section will be displayed. The scene will not change, new levels, players and enemies will be spawned on the same scene.
- Bullets damage must be 100
- Two types of enemies must be created, Simple Enemy and Big Enemy.
- Simple Enemy should have 100 health and 1 scale. It must attack directly above the player.
- Big Enemy should have 200 health and 1.5 scale. He must go around the player and attack from behind.
- How many enemies are left should be displayed on the UI.
- The player wins if all enemies are destroyed without making contact.
- If any enemy touches the player, the player is considered defeated.
- For the characters other than the playable character, a simple ai should be written and the enemies should attack the player.
- The project should be clean, readable, understandable and coded in accordance with design patterns.

I learned singleton and object pooling design pattern while doing this project. And I learn better about character animations.
