Augmented reality (AR) brings together real life and the digital world. It does this by creating a digital landscape or "canvas" around the user, in which digital content can interact with the user's physical surroundings
Though most augmented reality (AR) applications in medicine have been focused on surgery, AR-based use cases are expanding quickly throughout the full spectrum of care, including diagnostics, treatment planning, monitoring, mental health, and rehabilitation. 



This AR-based application was made for children receiving treatment at Koç Hospital. Our aim is to create a digital therapy friend who contributes to therapy by talking to children for 12 weeks. With this application, we won the Abdi İbrahim “We Heal the Future” contest. 

For this project, I build the mobile application in Unity by using Vuforia plugin.
