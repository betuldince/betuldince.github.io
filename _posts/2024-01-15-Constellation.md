Have you ever had the desire to craft your own constellation? This application allows you to create both unique constellations and explore existing ones.


While currently in the early stages of development, our ultimate objective is to build an augmented reality (AR) application capable of tracking the stars in the night sky. You can interact with your personally created constellation to document your stories and diaries. Selecting a constellation reveals a menu showcasing all its stars, each of which can be individually modified in terms of the star's name, story, attached image, or recorded voice message. All your entries are automatically saved when you exit the app. Additionally, we have plans to incorporate a multiplayer feature, enabling users to connect with friends within the application and share their unique constellations.

As a team, we are working on developing this project, and my responsibilities primarily involve app development in Unity.
