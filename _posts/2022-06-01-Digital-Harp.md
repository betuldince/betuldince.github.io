Are you also suffering from the recently increased instrument prices? I have some good news for you. You can create your own instrument in your house and play it without even actually touching it.

Let me introduce you. Digital Harp.

You just need to buy some cheap sensors, cables and Arduino to build it from scratch. And we will use touchdesigner as software which is free for one year use. 

Look how cool they are!

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
