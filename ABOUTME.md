Hi, I am an undergraduate engineering and art student at Koc University. I am passionate about technology and design. My research interests are immersive technologies, serios games, human-computer interaction, wearable sensors and signal processing. In future, I want to pursue a career in the development of AR/VR applications. I believe that immersive technologies should be more common and used not only for entertainment purposes but also medicine, education, refugees, data visualization and professional fields. I am highly motivated to make social impacts by designing experiences with immersive technologies.
