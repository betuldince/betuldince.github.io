Get ready to explore Koc University like never before and take a trip through time! If you're as excited as I am, all you need to do is put on your VR device – this application is designed just for you.

I created a roller coaster VR game set right on the Koc University Campus using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit for the Oculus Quest 2. I used an exact model of the campus, so when people play the Roller Coaster VR app, they are not just having fun – they are also getting to know the campus in a whole new way. I've always believed in the power of tech to make things exciting and educational, and this project is a perfect example.

## Story of the game:

We have an archeology student as our hero, and they goes on a journey to collect artifacts from the past. Our hero goes on a time-travelling roller coaster to collect artifacts for the ARHA department. Time travelling roller coaster is the latest product of the ENG department. After collecting the artifacts, our hero tries to come back but, unfortunately the machine gives an error and sends our hero to a wrong timeline. To be able to go back to ıts own timeline our hero should fix the roller-coaster.

Our character, who is studying archeology at Koç University, wants to go back in time to collect the trophies to be exhibited in the exhibition. They ride the roller coaster, which is actually a time machine. After collecting the artifacts, our hero tries to come back but, unfortunately the machine gives an error and sends our hero to a wrong timeline. To be able to go back to ıts own timeline our hero should fix the roller-coaster by collecting the items in future. To find out where the items are, our character has to solve school-related riddles.
