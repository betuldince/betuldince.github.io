Virtual Reality (VR) technology has ushered in a transformative era in the realm of occupational safety. By immersing workers in lifelike scenarios, VR enables them to experience potential workplace hazards firsthand, without any actual risk. This dynamic approach fosters a heightened sense of awareness, preparing employees to respond effectively to dangers. 


The application consists of two scenes. First scene is for explaining game to users and giving workers enough time to get used to VR. They wear gloves and helmet in this scene and they click the start button to start the experience.

In the second scene, there is a factory scene and the user select the risk by left controller. After they find all the risk, they can see their point and the time in the paper they are holding.
