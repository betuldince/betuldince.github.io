I developed multi-player fruit picking game in VR. In this game, there are 3 teams according to colors: blue, yellow and green. They are competing against time and trying to collect the fruits with most points. The one who got most points in the given time became a winner. 


For this game, I used Unity 3D, Oculus SDK, and online database servers for multi-player option.
