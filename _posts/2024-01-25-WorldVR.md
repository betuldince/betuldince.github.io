We're working on a VR game that aim to improve the lives of individuals dealing with Parkinson's disease (PD). 


Many people with PD face challenges in their walking abilities, making it difficult to navigate through various environments safely. The specific issues include difficulties in turning and managing both expected and unexpected obstacles.

Our focus has been on the development and assessment of a virtual reality training application called Wordplay VR. This innovative app is designed to provide individuals with PD a platform to enhance essential skills like turning, obstacle avoidance, and problem-solvingâ€”all while engaging in an enjoyable game-based environment. It's an exciting venture, and we're passionate about creating something that can make a positive impact on the lives of those with Parkinson's.

Previously, a team of developers was involved in constructing the project environment and handling development tasks. However, at present, I am the sole contributor to the project, undertaking diverse responsibilities ranging from game development and VR development to backend development and data analysis.
